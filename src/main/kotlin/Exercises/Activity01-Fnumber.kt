    //First, given number (num)'s value is stored in another integer variable, originalInteger. This is because, we need to compare the values of reversed number and original number at the end.
    //Then, a while loop is used to loop through num until it is equal to 0.
    //On each iteration, the last digit of num is stored in remainder.
    //Then, remainder is added to reversedInteger such that it is added to the next place value (multiplication by 10).
    //Then, the last digit is removed from num after division by 10.
    //Finally, reversedInteger and originalInteger are compared. If equal, it is a palindrome number. If not, it isn't.
